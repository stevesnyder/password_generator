    Front-end Interface:

        >When button is clicked, an alert box will drop down on the top of screen.
    
            Within alert box:

            -User is prompted password length between 8 and 129 characters.

            -User is asked to confirm 4 different character types to be included in password.
    
        >Once all questions are answered and alert box closes, a password that fits preferences is displayed on the page.

    Back-end mechanics:

        >variables declared and assigned a value
        
        >arrays containing different accepted characters
        
        >function to generate a password
            
            -declare variable for password length
            
            -open an alert box
                
                -prompt user for length of password
                -prompt user for character types
                    ~special characters
                    ~numeric characters
                    ~lowercase characters
                    ~uppercase character
                
            -generate password

                -declare variable with a value of an empty array.
                -declare variable for generated password.
                -conditional statements to ensure all desired characters are included in password and add all desired characters to empty array.
                -loop that runs x times, x being desired length of password.

                    -each time loop runs
                        ~select a random character from desired character array.
                        ~add the character to generated password variable.

                return generated password value.
